# reportWebVitals Component Documentation

## Overview
The provided code defines the `reportWebVitals` function, which is responsible for reporting web vitals metrics for performance monitoring. It utilizes the `web-vitals` library to collect metrics such as Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), First Input Delay (FID), First Contentful Paint (FCP), Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), and Time to First Byte (TTFB).

## Location of Code
The code for the `reportWebVitals` function can be found [here](https://github.com/nainisha-b/slash/blob/main/client/src/reportWebVitals.js).

## Code Description

### Function
1. **`reportWebVitals` Function:**
   - Exports a function named `reportWebVitals`.
   - Takes a callback function `onPerfEntry` as a parameter.

### Web Vitals Reporting
1. **Check and Import:**
   - Checks if `onPerfEntry` is a function and an instance of `Function`.
   - Imports the `web-vitals` library dynamically.

2. **Metrics Collection:**
   - Calls the `getCLS`, `getFID`, `getFCP`, `getLCP`, and `getTTFB` functions from the `web-vitals` library.
   - Passes the `onPerfEntry` callback function to each metric function for reporting.

## Usage
1. **Metrics Reporting:**
   - When implementing the web vitals metrics in a React application, this file is typically included in the application setup.
   - The `onPerfEntry` callback function can be customized to handle the received metrics data.

2. **Dynamic Import:**
   - Utilizes dynamic import to load the `web-vitals` library only when needed.
