# App Component Documentation

## Overview
The `App` component serves as the main entry point for rendering the interactive web page. It utilizes the Material-UI `ThemeProvider` to apply a custom theme and integrates routing with `BrowserRouter` from `react-router-dom`. Additionally, it includes the `CartProvider` to manage the shopping cart state.

## Location of Code
