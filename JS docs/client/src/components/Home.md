# Cart Context and Reducer Documentation

## Overview
This module implements a React component, `Home`, that serves as the main interface for a shopping cart in a React application. It utilizes Material-UI components and integrates with external cart data from a JSON file. The component fetches cart data upon mounting and displays it in a Material-UI Card along with a button to log the cart data to the console.

## Location of Code
The code for the Home component can be found [here](https://github.com/nainisha-b/slash/blob/main/client/src/components/Home.js).

## Code Description

### State Management

1. **State Hook**
   - `useState`: Manages the component's state, specifically the `cartData` state variable.

2. **Effect Hook**
   - `useEffect`: Executes the data fetching logic upon component mount, populating the `cartData` state with external cart data from `cartData.json`.

### Material-UI Components

1. **Card Component**
   - Material-UI `Card` is utilized to structure the main content of the shopping cart interface.

2. **Typography Component**
   - Material-UI `Typography` components are used to display static text, such as the cart name and version.

3. **Button Component**
   - Material-UI `Button` component triggers a console log of the current cart data when clicked.

### Data Rendering

1. **Conditional Rendering**
   - The component conditionally renders a table displaying cart data if the `cartData` array is not empty.

2. **Table Rendering**
   - The cart data is rendered in a table format, dynamically generating table headers and rows based on the structure of the cart data.

## Usage
1. **Component Integration:**
   - Integrate the `Home` component into your React application to serve as the main interface for the shopping cart.

2. **Data Fetching:**
   - Ensure that the external cart data file, `cartData.json`, is present and properly formatted for the component to fetch and display.

3. **Console Log Functionality:**
   - Utilize the "Get Cart Data" button to trigger a console log of the current cart data for debugging or monitoring purposes.

4. **Styling Customization:**
   - Customize the visual styling of the component by modifying the Material-UI styles defined in the `makeStyles` hook.
