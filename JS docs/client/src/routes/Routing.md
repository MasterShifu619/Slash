# Routing Component Documentation

## Overview
The `Routing` component is responsible for handling route configurations and rendering the corresponding components based on the defined routes. It utilizes the `Routes` and `Route` components from `react-router-dom`.

## Location of Code
The code for the `Routing` component can be found [here](https://github.com/nainisha-b/slash/blob/main/client/src/routes/Routing.js).

## Code Description

### Components
1. **Routes Component:**
   - Imported from `"react-router-dom"`.
   - Represents the container for managing route configurations.

2. **Route Component:**
   - Imported from `"react-router-dom"`.
   - Defines individual routes and specifies the corresponding components to render.

### Routes Configuration
1. **routes:**
   - Imported from `"../configs/routes"`.
   - Defines the routes, including their paths, names, and associated components.

### Filtering Private Routes
1. **Filtering Private Routes:**
   - Uses `.filter()` to exclude private routes based on the `isPrivate` property.

### Rendering Routes
1. **Mapping and Rendering Routes:**
   - Utilizes `.map()` to iterate over the filtered routes and render corresponding `Route` components.

## Usage
1. **Integration with Main Component:**
   - Include the `Routing` component within the main component or layout where routing is needed.

2. **Route Configuration:**
   - Ensure that the `routes` configuration includes the necessary information for each route, such as `path`, `name`, and `element`.
